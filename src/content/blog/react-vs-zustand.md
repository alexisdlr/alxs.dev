<h1 class='text-4xl font-black my-12 text-slate-700 dark:text-darkText/90'>Intro</h1>

<p class='text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100 mb-10 text-xl'>In this article, I'd like to delve a little deeper into what are the <span class='text-astro-pink dark:text-iris font-semibold'>advantages and disadvantages</span> of both utilities. Whether you are an experienced React developer or new to state management, understanding these distinctions will allow you to make well-informed decisions for your projects. </p>

<h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-700 dark:text-darkText'>Zustand</h2>

![zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/raw/main/bear.jpg)

<p class='text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100 my-12 text-xl'><span class='text-astro-pink dark:text-iris font-semibold'>Zustand</span> is a lightweight state management library for React applications. It offers a simple and intuitive API, facilitating management and exchange of states between components. Zustand follows a minimalist approach and takes advantage of React hooks to provide reactive status updates. With its small package size and emphasis on performance, Zustand is ideal for smaller projects or situations where a lightweight state management solution is preferred.</p>

<h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-700 dark:text-darkText'>Redux</h2>

![redux](https://redux.js.org/img/redux-logo-landscape.png)

<p class='text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100 my-12 text-xl'><span class='text-astro-pink dark:text-iris font-semibold'>Redux</span> is a powerful state management library for React and other JavaScript applications. It implements the Flux architecture and uses a single immutable state tree, providing a predictable state management system. Redux follows strict Flux principles, making it suitable for large-scale applications with complex state management needs. Although Redux requires some boilerplate code, it offers features such as middleware and time-travel debugging, which can be valuable for larger projects with complex state interactions.
</p>

<h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-700 dark:text-darkText'>Why choose Zustand?</h2>

<p class='text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100 my-12 text-xl px-6'><span class='text-astro-pink dark:text-iris font-semibold'>Simplicity:</span> It adopts a minimalist and straightforward API, making it easier to configure and use compared to Redux. With Zustand, developers can manage state with less Boilerplate and enjoy a more streamlined experience.
</p>
<p class='text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100 my-12 text-xl px-6'><span class='text-astro-pink dark:text-iris font-semibold'>Lightweight:</span> It has a smaller bundle size compared to Redux. This smaller footprint is an advantage for applications that prioritize performance and loading speed, especially in scenarios where reducing bundle size is crucial.
</p>

<p class='text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100 my-12 text-xl px-6'><span class='text-astro-pink dark:text-iris font-semibold'>Integration with React Hooks:</span> Seamlessly integrates with the React hook system. Leveraging useReducer and useContext, providing a more native and familiar development experience for React developers.
